- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kaiju Morquecho! (they/them)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in almost all environmental topics that fall under the environmental justice umbrella, but more specifically my passion lies in food justice, land sovereignty and data sovereignty. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning environmental data science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management while being a full-time staff member on campus.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: I grew up in Mexico, Aguascalientes, and lived there until moving here in 2012, so I have officially lived half of my life in one country and the other half in another (US)!
